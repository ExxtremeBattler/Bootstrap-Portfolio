# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio of work in Bootstrap, in order to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

Through this project, I learnt quite a bit about being able to install and implement Bootstrap into my Front-End solutions.
## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

The page contains the following sections:

The 'Navbar' on the top of the page will help you quickly navigate to the relevant sections. 
(NOTE: The searchbar is currently unoperational. Search functionality is being worked on!)

'Skills' simply provides general information about my current skills.

'Work' serves as a showcase for some of my projects thus far; clicking the images of any projects will take you to the deployed application.

'About / Contact Me' provides some personal info, as well as contact information for when you will want to get in touch!
